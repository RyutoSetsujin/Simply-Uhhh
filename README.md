(Unlike Horsey's fork, this has only been tested on the latest public release of Project OutFox.)

# What is Simply Uhhh?
Simply Uhhh is meant to be a fork of Simply Love made to add more visual elements and customization options to Simply Love, as well as to provide slight tweaks and such that I think would be nice to have.

## What happened to Virtua Steps?
Don't worry! That's still being worked on. This is just a side project.
